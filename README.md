Project Title:
Animated Progress Bar

Project Description:
The Animated Progress Bar project is a visually appealing and interactive way to showcase different skills and their respective proficiency levels.

3.Customizable Design: The layout, colors, and animation speed can be easily modified to match different styles or themes.
4.Responsive Layout: The design is responsive and works well on various screen sizes.
